# Task 4 & 5

Created a new branch named **Temp** and added a README file `Task_3.md` describing Task 3.  
Merged the Temp branch back into the main branch and verified that all files were combined successfully.

## Commands Used
```bash
git checkout -b Temp
git add Task_3.md
git commit -m "Add Task_3.md for Task 3"
git push -u origin Temp
git checkout main
git merge Temp
git add Task_4_5.md
git commit -m "Add Task_4_5.md for Task 4 & 5"
git push
```
